(this is the version meant for command line use, with no UI. for the version with UI, see the master branch)

For Calculating the matrix of transformations on the unit circle.
Takes an angle from the start of a transformation and the angle the transform should end on, then outputs the matrix that encodes that transform.

Requires the numpy library. install it by going to your command line and pasting 'pip install numpy'. You will also need python 3 or later installed.
